          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>Nah was born as a half-breed Manakete and is proud of her Manakete
            heritage. Nah is a unique Manakete, unlike Nowi and Tiki (and
            potentially Morgan), as Nah's transformed skintone is a unique shade
            of pink rather than the standard yellow-green. Nah was too young to
            remember her mother, Nowi, and her father as they had died in battle.
            Nah was given Nowi's wedding ring, which she always wears. Orphaned,
            Nah was sent to a family of one of her father's army friends. However,
            the family was unkind to Nah because of her hybrid status. Nah did her
            best to appease her new family by doing chores before being asked and
            defending their household from Risen at night. Despite all this, not
            one of her foster family was ever grateful nor did they ever
            acknowledge her. Nah lived feeling alone and unwanted, only wishing
            for her parents to return home. Eventually she joined Lucina and the
            rest of the children to return to the past to prevent the ruinous
            future.</p>
          <p>In her Paralogue, Nah is lost in the Manor of Lost Souls and Risen
            soldiers have swarmed the manor. Luckily, Chrom's army is nearby
            with her mother, Nowi, who manages to find her. Nowi is ecstatic to
            meet another Manakete, though is confused with Nah's name.
            Nevertheless Nah joins Chrom's army after they leave the Manor. With
            nowhere to go, Nah offers to stay with Chrom's army, which Chrom
            happily accepts. Nah asks Nowi if she recognizes the ring on her
            finger. Nowi notices that it's the exact same ring as her ring from
            her husband. Nah explains that it is the exact same one which she
            got after Nowi died in the future. Nowi senses that Nah is fighting
            back tears, but Nah tells her since she is a manakete, she must
            maintain a strong appearance. Nowi tells her it is okay since she
            cries a lot herself. Nah finally cries, happy to be reunited with
            her mother.</p>
          <p>After the war, Nah would spend the rest of her long, Manakete life
            educating humans about Grima.</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>In contrast to her mother, Nah tries to be mature for her age and is
            accustomed to controlling her emotions. This is due in part to her
            upbringing of neglect by her foster family as they did not give Nah
            the emotional or familial support she desired after the loss of her
            parents. Her desperation to gain their attention and affection lead to
            a desire to prove her worthiness so she would not be cast aside again
            in the present timeline.</p>
          <p>She is proud of her Manakete heritage and is eager to learn all she
            can about the Manakete way of life once she arrived in the present
            timeline. She has inherited much of the Manakete physical traits and
            has stated that she occasionally has feral urges which she unleashes
            from time to time in a secluded forest to prevent her allies from
            being caught during her rampages. She strikes up a friendship with
            Tiki, but has come to terms with the fate of all Manaketes and their
            relationship with humans, namely that she will vastly outlive most of
            her comrades. She does vow to make the most of the time she has with
            her human friends and especially her father.</p>
          <p>Her bond with her mother in particular, the source of her Manakete
            heritage, is a somewhat strained one as Nowi's carefree nature clashes
            with her serious one. However, she later learns after spending time
            with her that Nowi's playtime between battles is simply a method for
            her to train and Nah begins to respect her more, taking Nowi's
            suggestions more to heart.</p>
          <p>Despite her outward appearance of maturity, she still has moments of
            childishness and is essentially still a child in Manakete years. She
            can be somewhat possessive of people, especially in the cases of her
            support with Inigo and Gerome. Nah openly questions her father's
            intentions to marry Nowi, but immediately drops the subject when they
            snap at her for being rude. She uses her Manakete form as a threat,
            declaring that she will devour whomever is disturbing her.</p>
          <p>Nah also, to an extent, dislikes her unusual name and wishes that she
            had a much more normal one. She has the best teeth in the army.</p>
